# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds password protection to the existing CSAT dashboard. Users must enter the correct password ("admin123") before they can access the dashboard content. The password protection screen will use the same Starlinks branding and design system as the existing dashboard to maintain visual consistency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard administrator, I want to protect the CSAT dashboard with a password, so that only authorized users can access sensitive customer satisfaction data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a password protection screen before showing any dashboard content
2. WHEN the password protection screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the Starlinks logo and branding consistent with the existing dashboard design
3. WHEN a user enters the correct password ("admin123") THEN the system SHALL hide the password screen and display the full dashboard
4. WHEN a user enters an incorrect password THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow them to try again
5. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL remember their authentication for the browser session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the password screen to look professional and consistent with the dashboard design, so that I have confidence in the security and legitimacy of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the password screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same CSS design system variables as the existing dashboard
2. WHEN the password screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL include the Starlinks logo and "Protected Page" title
3. WHEN the password screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same glassmorphism effects and styling as the dashboard cards
4. WHEN the password screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL be responsive and work on mobile devices
5. WHEN the password screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper focus states and accessibility features

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want my authentication to persist during my browser session, so that I don't have to re-enter the password every time I refresh the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL store the authentication state in sessionStorage
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page after authentication THEN the system SHALL check sessionStorage and bypass the password screen if authenticated
3. WHEN a user closes their browser tab THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication state
4. WHEN a user opens the dashboard in a new tab THEN the system SHALL require password authentication again
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL show the password screen again on next page load
